# 📝 Task Management System
This project is a console-based Task Management System built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to register, log in, and manage personal tasks with priorities, deadlines, categories, and status tracking.

The system is modular, extensible, and includes unit tests with Google Test.

## 📦 Features
🧑‍💼 User Management
  - 🔹 Register, log in, and log out securely with credentials.
  - 🔹 Unique ID assigned to each user.

## 🗂️ Task Handling
- Add, edit, delete, and view tasks.
- Each task includes:
  - 🔹 Title  
  - 🔹 Description  
  - 🔹 Category  
  - 🔹 Deadline  
  - 🔹 Priority (LOW, MID, HIGH, URGENT)  
  - 🔹 Status (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)

## 📋 Task Overview
  -  View all tasks (admin style) or only personal tasks.
  -  Display tasks grouped by user.

## ✅ Unit Testing
  - Modular code tested with Google Test framework.
